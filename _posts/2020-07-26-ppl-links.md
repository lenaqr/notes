title: Two probabilistic programming links

A preprint from my former lab: [Automating Involutive MCMC using Probabilistic
and Differentiable Programming][0]. Involutive MCMC is a recently introduced
framework that expresses various common MCMC algorithms as instances of a common
pattern. The authors show how this pattern is supported as a probabilistic
programming abstraction in [Gen][gen], allowing users to write customized
inference algorithms for probabilistic models while automating the error-prone
parts and providing free invariant checks.

model in various PPLs][1].
