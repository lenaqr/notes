Update: I've consolidated and added more links.

Here are some probabilistic-modeling-adjacent materials I've recently found interesting. No particular order or unifying theme here.

- [Bayesian Deep Learning and Probabilistic Model Construction](https://youtu.be/E1qhGw8QxqY) (video), Andrew Gordon Wilson, ICML 2020. Also, [The Case for Bayesian Deep Learning](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/caseforbdl/).

- [Principled Model Building Workflow](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html), Michael Betancourt. Actually, all of his [case studies](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/) are illuminating.

- [A biased tour of the uncertainty visualization zoo](https://youtu.be/E1kSnWvqCw0) (video), Matthew Kay, Tapestry 2018.

- [Bayesian Inference without Probability Density Functions](https://youtu.be/_wfZSvasLFk) (video), Ben Goodrich, StanCon 2020.

- [Measure Theory for Probabilistic Modeling](https://informativeprior.com/blog/2021/01-28-measure-theory/), Chad Scherrer.

- Example of [Using Bayesian Decision Making to Optimize Supply Chains](https://twiecki.io/blog/2019/01/14/supply_chain/), Thomas Wiecki.

- Comparing [Dirichlet Process Gaussian mixture model in
various PPLs](https://luiarthur.github.io/TuringBnpBenchmarks/dpsbgmm).
