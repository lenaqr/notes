Over the weekend I caught up on a small backlog of talk videos I had bookmarked.
They were all pretty interesting, so I figured I'd share:

[Bayesian Deep Learning and Probabilistic Model Construction][agw] (Andrew Gordon Wilson, ICML 2020)

[Bayesian Inference without Probability Density Functions][bg] (Ben Goodrich, StanCon 2020)

[A biased tour of the uncertainty visualization zoo][mk] (Matthew Kay, Tapestry 2018)
